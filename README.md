# Student Record System in Python

This project demonstrates how a school can save and manage student records in Python.
It includes multiple concepts such as lists, OOP (Object-Oriented Programming), abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and decorators.

This repository is perfect for beginners who want to learn Python and understand how real-world objects can be modeled using classes and objects.


# **Features Covered**

1. Student Records Using Lists
Basic storage of student details using Python lists
Simple printing and formatting using f-strings

2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts
This project includes all four core principles of OOP:

✔ Abstraction
Hiding unnecessary details using methods.

✔ Encapsulation
Protecting data using private attributes (__attribute) and getter methods.

✔ Inheritance
Reusing parent class properties and methods in a child class.

✔ Polymorphism
Same method name behaving differently in different classes.

#  🍦 Decorators

Demonstrates Python decorators and method chaining using:

Custom decorators
Passing functions as arguments
Layered decorators (e.g., @add_sprinkles + @add_fudge)
